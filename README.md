# Marina Nikiforova
# Resume for CSC-131 Spring 2018

I have received my initial credits in Computer Science from American River College, where majority of the programming was done in C and C++, which I'm very comfortable with. During that time I also was exposed to some Assembly language programming. At SacState I began programming in Java, HTML/CSS and Javascript. 

During my breaks I work with my husband at his design studio CreativeDash as a project manager and provide social media support for our other business UI8.net which is a marketplace for designers and developers.
